## Project Title
**CoreWill - Asset security and Inheritance Platform**

---

## Project Description
CoreWill is a decentralized inheritance management platform deployed on Core DAO Testnet2 that automatically distributes digital assets to beneficiaries when wallet owners become inactive. The platform solves the critical problem of lost digital assets due to improper private key management and lack of backup systems.

## Project Vision
Many digital assets are lost in wallets due to improper private key management and no backups. CoreWill ensures you do not lose your cold assets (assets you don't trade regularly) by setting up an inheritance system that automatically transfers your digital wealth to designated beneficiaries when you become inactive.

## Future Scope
- **Mainnet deployment** on Core DAO mainnet for production use
- **Adding multisig functionality** for enhanced security and shared control
- **Enhanced monitoring algorithms** for better activity detection
- **Mobile application** for on-the-go contract management
- **Integration with hardware wallets** for additional security layers
- **Multi-token support** beyond native Core tokens
- **Advanced notification systems** for beneficiaries and contract owners

## Key Features
- **Create inheritance contracts** with beneficiaries' wallets which inherit the assets
- **Automated monitoring** of wallet activity via active node process running 24/7
- **Emergency withdrawal capabilities** for users to reclaim funds anytime
- **Activity reset functionality** to manually show activity and restart timers
- **Real-time dashboard** with comprehensive contract management interface
- **Beneficiary claim system** for seamless inheritance claiming
- **Multi-contract support** allowing users to create multiple inheritance contracts
- **Time-based triggers** with customizable inactivity periods
- **Transparent monitoring** with real-time status updates and health checks

## Demo 

**Live Application**: [https://corewill.up.railway.app/](https://corewill.up.railway.app/)

**Features to explore:**
- Connect your Core DAO Testnet2 wallet
- Create your first inheritance contract
- Monitor real-time contract status
- Experience the automated monitoring system
- Test beneficiary claiming functionality

---

## How It Works 

1. **Connect Wallet** - Connect your Core DAO Testnet2 wallet
2. **Create Contract** - Set beneficiary, amount, and inactivity period
3. **Automated Monitoring** - Our system monitors your wallet activity 24/7
4. **Inheritance Triggered** - If inactive for set period, inheritance becomes claimable
5. **Beneficiary Claims** - Designated beneficiary can claim the inheritance
